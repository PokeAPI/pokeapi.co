        <p>
            After careful deliberation, we have decided to end support for
            Pok√©API version 1, effective 15 October 2018. If you still rely on
            version 1, it should be fairly simple to move your app to version 2
            (<Link to="/docs/v2">view the documentation</Link>
            ).
        </p>
        <p>
            Although we value backwards compatibility, version 1 was deprecated
            in December 2014, and continuing to support it adds significant
            complexity to the project's aim to move to static hosting.
            Furthermore, at the present time (15 October 2018) we only receive around 1&nbsp;000 daily API hits for
            version 1, compared to 20&nbsp;000 hits for version 2. Finally,
            unbeknownst to us, some parts of the version 1 API have been broken
            for a significant period of time, but we have received no
            complaints.
        </p>
        <p>
            After 15 October 2018, any requests for the version 1 API will
            receive a{' '}
            <a href="https://httpstatuses.com/301">301 Moved Permanently</a>{' '}
            response.
