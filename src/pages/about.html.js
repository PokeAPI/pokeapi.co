                    This website provides a RESTful API interface to highly
                    detailed objects built from thousands of lines of data
                    related to{' '}
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pokemon">Pokémon</a>.
                    We specifically cover the video game franchise. Using this
                    website, you can consume information on Pokémon, their
                    moves, abilities, types, egg groups and much, much more.

            <Faq title="What is an API?">
                <p>
                    An API (Application Programming Interface) is a contract
                    that allow developers to interact with an application
                    through a set of interfaces. In this case, the application
                    is a database of thousands of Pokémon-related objects, and
                    the interfaces are URL links.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A RESTful API is an API that conforms to a set of loose
                    conventions based on HTTP verbs, errors, and hyperlinks.

            <Faq title="Aren't there 101 other Pokémon websites already?">
                <p>Yes and that's exactly the problem!</p>
                <p>
                    101 instances of the same website means 101 instances of the{' '}
                    <strong>same data</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We aim to provide a <strong>single source of data</strong>{' '}
                    that any number of other websites can consume and use.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Often, and especially when new Pokémon games or updates are
                    released, those 101+ websites take <strong>weeks</strong> to
                    update as people have to enter the same information in all
                    those different places.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This solves that problem. If all those sites consumed their
                    data from here, they would have the exact same information
                    that is updated at exactly the same time, with no errors
                    between each website. The overall benefit is a better
                    collaboration and consistency across all the different
                    Pokémon websites and applications. It's good for all!

                    Paul deprecated V1 in favor of working on V2.

                    jumped in. Zane thought the original project was a fantastic
                    idea and wanted to help it grow. With direction from Paul,
                    Zane created the V2 API using an exact mirror of{' '}

                    to the main series of games.

                <p>
                    During summer 2018, Paul decided to hand over the project to
                    the community. A group of contributors came together and
                    converted the API to serve static JSON files to improve
                    performance and cut down on hosting costs. This website was
                    also re-built at the same time. This process was completed
                    in October 2018.

                    In October 2018, the API was converted to serve static JSON

                    The move to static hosting was solved by introducing a build
